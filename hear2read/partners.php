						<h2>Hear2Read values its Partners.</h2>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Our Partners contribute in many different ways with our mission:</p>
						<p><strong>Authors and Publishers:</strong> Provide text content (Corpora) in different languages to help us build the
			 				Text To Speech database (voice) for Indian languages. They also provide us books and stories to test the TTS software.</p>
						<p><strong>Developers:</strong> Develop Android Apps and technology tools for reading digital content (including web
							sites, books, documents, spreadsheets and presentations) using Text To Speech software.</p>
						<p><strong>Research Partners:</strong> A number of research associates contribute their time to find newer ways of 
							improving the experience for our Visually Challenged Users.</p>
						<p><strong>Supporters:</strong> Donors sponsor Research at Academic Institutes, such as, Carnegie Mellon 
							University, Language Technology Institute. You can help us by donating online at 
							<a href="http://icaonline.org/donate" target="_blank">Indians for Collective Action (ICA)</a> (Please 
							select Hear2Read in the Project drop down Menu)</p>
						<p><strong>Visually Challenged Users:</strong> Though Text To Speech software is used by many people with good sight, 
							our mission is to help the Visually Challenged and Print Disabled population read digital content in Indian languages. 
							We work with schools and resource centers for the visually challenged in India to ensure the Apps meet the needs of this 
							population. These partners provide us valuable guidance to make sure that the Apps are useable.</p>
